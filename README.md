tools and IDE: visual studio , Git.

programming language: C++

Design and class diagram: in this project we depended on OOP Concepts to build it as our program consists of 2 major classes express the entities exists in the project

class Node: it is resposible for the server which measure the temperature at specific location. as here we do not have an hardware like temperature sensor so we use an random number generation to give us an imaginary random mearsures within a specific range that the sensor can measure. instead if we use arduino and simulator we can do this easily and will give us a true measures.

class Client: here we made a client class to expresses the entity of it as it made the calculations and remain their history in a containers.

Data structures we used: We mainly depended on VECTORS as we need to have a dynamically arrays.

our program main files: it consists of : .h and .cpp file for each class and another .cpp file which is the main function that contains code that make the prohgram run and some tests.
